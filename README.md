# Raspberrypi-alarm-clock
An alarm clock program written in python and javascript that uses official 7inch touchscreen and sensors.
## Basic info
I use this program for setting alarm and control the near IOT object. This program is simply divided by GUI, background process, web server(of course i will include database later). This smart alarm clock serve as a multi functional interface so I included digital,analog clock and home sensing system. and Users can control this program using remote control by their smartphone(I am still considering efficient method for data communication instead of Queue transfer and I will update 
and revise CSS and html for various types of resolutions. It only support iphone 12). And i am still thiking what design
would be motivating for waking users up in the morning.

images show that it provide various UI to sense many types of information in the house and it light up the neopixel when alarm rings and make an announcement of today's weather and recent news and turn on the music.
